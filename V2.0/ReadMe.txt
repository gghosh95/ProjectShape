This is the latest version of this project
In the previous versions, graphics were generated using in-built Java 2D graphics package
There was little hope for 3D graphics functionalities
In this version, I have integrated the jMonkeyEngine. (It is an open-source game development package)
This enables to create 3D and 2D graphics in an elegant manner

NOTE: I have removed many functions from the previous version, I intend to extend this framework for scientific computing routines

NOTE: You can use it as you like but the libraries may cause some issues. If you face any problems refer to jMonkeyEngine documentation.
This project is far from being a .exe type source code. 
If it still persists, get a DevOps guy to look at it, I am an algorithms guy :)
